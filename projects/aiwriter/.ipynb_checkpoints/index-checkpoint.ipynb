      "We brush the drama aside to take a statistical look at the biggest personalities on Twitch in terms of fans, subscribers and revenue. Twitch is popular enough to sustain and grow its audience despite a COVID-inspired surge in viewership in 2020. Its continued success isn't a revelation, but a new study by Britain's biggest gaming retailer has uncovered a few surprises in 2021 about the most popular streamers and games on the platform.\n",
      "Twitch is considered the leading social media platform for gamers and sports professionals. If you want to stand up to the community of competitive players, enthusiasts, and everyone else who loves the digital world, you should include Twitch Streamers in your influencer marketing strategy. Some of Twitter's top streamers earn $100,000 a month just for games.\n",
      "Twitch has become a place where streamers can rise and gain a huge following over time through the ranks. While top game influencers have a large following on Twitch, the platform is still dominated by male streamers but female streamers are on the rise. Most of the top female streamers of 2020 play video games and spend most of their time in the chat category.\n",
      "Riot Games, the most popular Twitch streamer, has a channel dedicated to live stream League of Legends games. The best Twitch streamers are active between 60 and 70 hours a week, one of them daily. They have several brand partnerships, including with Monster Energy and Audio Technica.\n",
      "He also shares videos of several games, with his appearances in the Fortnite game being the most popular. He currently has 2.1 million followers on his Twitch channel, and of course his YouTube channel has 1 million subscribers. Specifically designed for live streaming of League of Legends games, the channel is the most popular League of Legends channel on Twitch and the second most watched overall.\n",
      "A former professional Overwatch player, he is now a full-time streamer on Twitch and is one of the most watched streamers on the list. Nick Kolcheff competes in Fortnite, but remains one of the best Battle Royale players on Twitch. With his breathtaking Minecraft abilities, he has thrilled 19,246 viewers per stream as of December 2020. It started last year with a modest 26,000 followers and has grown to more than 3 million in that time.\n",
      "While his stream is mostly about his teams \"daily training in Warzone, he continues to make content on YouTube. He's a true variety streamer that can be prone to controversy, but with 5.9 million followers he's one of the top 10 esports game streamers on Twitch.\n",
      "Rounding out the top 10 list of top 10 streamers, we return to Twitch's game king, Fortnite. Ryan \"Chaplo\" Chaplo, fourth on the list, is one of the best professionals in the world.\n",
      "Ninja is a professional gambler who streams Fortnite games live on Twitch. While Ninja is most popular with Fortnites, he also streams videos from other games such as Battlefield V and Realm Royale.\n",
      "Next on the list is Rubius, a streamer on Twitch who mainly plays games in Spanish. Rubius has been around for several years and started out as a popular YouTuber. He's had plenty of success on Twitch, averaging a ton of viewers on his stream.\n",
      "With 7.8 million followers, Rubius is the fourth most subscribed channel on Twitch. Summit is one of the most subscribed streamers on the platform with over 20,000 active subscribers.\n",
      "With so much player content on other platforms like YouTube, you don't have to be a fan of Twitch. With popular streamers recording your game and streaming it on the platform, you're guaranteed to get a massive influx of players and record sales. Shroud (4,066,999 Twitch followers, 54,413 Twitch subscribers) - Shroud is one of the most popular Twitch streamers in the world.\n",
      "Summit1G - Jaryd Lazar - Lazar is one of the longest-serving players on the list of the most paid Twitch streamers. Estimates of his value range from $2 million to $7.5 million, but there is no doubt that he earned a reputation as one of the best multi-title streaming in Sea of Thieves, Day of Z, Escape from Tarkov, GTA, etc. Lazar has 5.9 million followers and signed an exclusive deal with Twitch in 2020. The newest name on this list is Syndicate, who is known for being the first streamer with a single stream to have over a million views on our list.\n",
      "The former Dallas Fuel pro has joined Luminosity Gaming as a full-time streamer and has made his disappointment with Season 5 of Fortnite clear by working on Offline TV, the Rust server and more. Turner Tue's - Tenney is one of the highest paid Fortnite players in the world and plays for the FaZe clan. According to his profile, he is \"one of the best Fortnies players in history\" and has won more than $700,000 in the game.\n",
      "Unsurpassed in total time (14.89 million hours) on the former Dallas Fuel Pro's Twitch channel there is no doubt that he was the most-watched streamer on Twitch last year. Ali Kabbani is the fourth most viewed Fortnite streamer as he is a member of SoloMid Team and has 7.2 million followers.
