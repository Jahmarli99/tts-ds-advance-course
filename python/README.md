### Data Science Advanced Topics: Python

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/tts-ds-advance-course/blob/master/python/index.ipynb)

Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability with its notable use of significant whitespace.

### Data Science Advanced Topics: Python-based Web Framework - Django

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/tts-ds-advance-course/blob/master/frameworks/10_mod_django/index.ipynb)

Django is a Python-based free and open-source web framework, which follows the model-template-view architectural pattern.

### Data Science Advanced Topics: Python-based Web Framework - Flask

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/tts-ds-advance-course/blob/master/frameworks/11_mod_flask/index.ipynb)

Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.

### Data Science Advanced Topics: Julia

[![Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/enterlifeonline/tts-ds-advance-course/blob/master/julia/index.ipynb)

Julia is a high-level, high-performance, dynamic programming language. While it is a general purpose language and can be used to write any application, many of its features are well-suited for high-performance numerical analysis and computational science.

## Package Application Managers

You can install the executables of Anaconda, Conda, Python or you can use a Package Application Manager that is applicable to your operating system. This allows you to maintain, update, install and configure all the necessary software components via automated scripting.

- [Brew (OS X, Linux)](https://brew.sh/)
- [Chocolatey (Windows)](https://chocolatey.org/)

## What is BREW?

For Mac OS, Linux

Home-brew installs the stuff you need that Apple or your Linux system didn’t.  
[See list of all packages](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/)

    ⁃	BREW package definition files are called “formulae”
    ⁃	BREW “cask”, just like a formula, is for GUI installs.
    ⁃	BREW “cellar” is where everything is installed /usr/local/Cellar

The simplest way to create a formula for your own software is to create a GitHub repository called homebrew-<something>; put your formula file in it; then type brew tap <username>/<something> to add this new source of formulae to your Homebrew installation and so get access to all its formulae.

Companies have internal Homebrew taps for their own utilities. There are a lot of public taps like homebrew/science for scientific software, atlassian/tap for Atlassian software, and ska-sa/tap for radio astronomy.

**[Brew Formulae / Casks](https://formulae.brew.sh/)**

## What is CHOCOLATEY?

For Windows

Chocolatey has the largest online registry of Windows packages. Chocolatey packages encapsulate everything required to manage a particular piece of software into one deployment artifact by wrapping installers, executables, zips, and/or scripts into a compiled package file.
